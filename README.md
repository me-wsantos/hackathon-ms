### **1. Intelligent Resume Extraction (Azure Document Intelligence)**
- We use Azure Document Intelligence to extract crucial information from resumes quickly and accurately.
- This significantly reduces resume analysis time, ensures no talent is overlooked, and enables more efficient matching between candidates and jobs. This automation ensures impartial analysis, focusing on relevant qualifications and experiences.

### **2. Personalized Career Plan**
- The system performs a detailed SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis of the candidate.
- This analysis provides a clear view of the candidate's competencies and areas that need development. The resulting career plan is a strategic guide for professional growth, helping the individual focus on their goals and overcome challenges. This increases self-confidence and motivation, essential for a successful trajectory.

### **3. Personalized Interview Questionnaire**
- The system generates a customized interview questionnaire to assist the coach in conducting more effective interviews.
- The questionnaire helps identify unique talents and specific areas for improvement for each candidate.
- The personalized questionnaire allows for a more complete and fair assessment, ensuring that the candidate has the opportunity to highlight their relevant skills and experiences. This facilitates the creation of individualized development plans and the monitoring of the candidate's progress.

### **4. ChatBot Assistant**
- An intelligent chat tool that helps the coach obtain quick and personalized information about the candidate.
- This assistant answers specific questions about the candidate's profile, such as skills, experiences, and areas of interest, based on information extracted from the resume and other data sources.
- This saves the coach time, allowing them to focus on more strategic aspects of the recruitment and development process. In addition, the ChatBot can provide additional insights that could go unnoticed in a manual analysis.
